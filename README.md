Simple Metaheuristics for Scheduling
==============
Code implementing metaheuristics for variety of scheduling problems.

Background
----------
This code was written in support of a doctoral [thesis][dr], which explored ways to automate the development of algorithms to identify reasonable solutions to combinatorial optimization problems.

Usage
-----
See Makefile

Acknowledgments
---------------
This work was carried out in the context of Metaheuristics Network, a research training network for the EU FP5 programme.
